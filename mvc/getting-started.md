# MVC Explained

#### 

#### The MVC Pattern

**Model:** Structures your data in a reliable form and prepares it based on controller’s instructions

**View:** Displays data to user in easy-to-understand format, based on the user’s actions

**Controller:** Takes in user commands, sends commands to the model for data updates, sends instructions to view to update interface.

**MVC analogy: Ordering drinks at a bar.**
You enter a bar on a Friday night, and approach the bartender. Since the bar is already crowded, you push through a crowd until you finally catch the bartender’s attention, and you blurt out, “One Manhattan, please!”

You \(the user\), order a cocktail at a bar \(user request\).

To the bartender, this cocktail is merely a series of steps:

1. lksdjf
2. dskjbf



Grab glass  
Add whiskey  
Add vermouth  
Add bitters  
Stir drink  
Add cherry  
Ask for credit card and charge.
