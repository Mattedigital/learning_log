### Redux

The **key components **of a React+Redux App are the following:

1. Reducers - A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state
2. Containers - A container wraps a React component and makes available to him the piece of state we need to pass to it as props inside the component.
3. Actions \(and ActionCreators\)



**When a component needs to know about a particular piece of state from our **_**Redux Store**_**, then it needs to be a container.**
