**Key principles of redux:**

1. The state is only ever read only.
2. The state can only ever be changed by dispatching an action.
3. To describe state mutations you have to write a function that takes the previous state of the app, the action being dispatched  & returns the next state of the app. This function needs to be a pure function. This function is called the reducer.
