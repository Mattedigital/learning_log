### Redux

The **key components**of a React+Redux App are the following:

1. Reducers - A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state
2. Containers - A container wraps a _React _component and makes available to him the piece of state we need to pass to it as _props _inside the component.
3. Actions \(and ActionCreators\)
