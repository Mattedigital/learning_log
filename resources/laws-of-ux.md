# Laws of UX

**Fitts's Law:** The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

**Hick's Law:** The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

**Jakob's Law:** Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

**Law of Pr√§gnanz:** People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.

**Law of Proximity:** Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

**Miller's Law:** The average person can only keep 7 \(plus or minus 2\) items in their working memory.

**Pareto Principle:** The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

**Parkinson's Law:** Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.

**Serial Position Effect:** Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.

**Tesler's Law:** Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.

**Von Restorff Effect:** The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

**Zeigarnik Effect:** People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
